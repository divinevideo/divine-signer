# Repository Guidelines

## Divine Context And Brain

Before broad product, architecture, protocol, cross-repo, service-boundary, or pull-request authoring, review, or modification work, read the shared Divine context primer.

Resolve the context directory and clone it there if it is missing:

```bash
CONTEXT_DIR="${DIVINE_CONTEXT_ROOT:-../divine-context}"
[ -e "$CONTEXT_DIR/.git" ] || gh repo clone divinevideo/divine-context "$CONTEXT_DIR"
```

Use that value as `<context-dir>` below.

The `divine-context` repo is private, so cloning requires GitHub access. If clone, network, or auth fails, continue from the local repo docs and avoid cross-repo assumptions.

Before updating an existing context checkout, verify it is clean and on its default branch. If it is clean and on the default branch, update it with `git -C <context-dir> pull --ff-only`. If it is dirty, on another branch, cannot fast-forward, or network/auth fails, leave it untouched and say the context may be stale.

Read `<context-dir>/AGENT_CONTEXT.md` and follow its instructions. If unavailable, continue from the local repo docs and avoid cross-repo assumptions.

Before working on a pull request, follow `<context-dir>/PR_REVIEW.md` and use `<context-dir>/PR_REVIEW_TEAMS.md` to request the normal team and check takeover authority. Ordinary review remains open to any eligible Divine human. Before modifying a pull-request branch, enforce the mapping and every takeover gate; if the mapping cannot be read, feedback-only review may continue but automated takeover must stop. Request and verify required human review automatically when tooling permits. If the runbook is unavailable, leave the pull request open and report the blocker.

If a Divine Brain search or ask tool is available, you may use it for company memory. Treat it as optional and credentialed: tool names vary by client, and work must continue when Brain is unavailable. When Brain results influence work, cite the returned document ids. Never commit Brain credentials or expose Brain-derived sensitive content in public PRs, issues, branch names, commit messages, code comments, logs, screenshots, release notes, or externally shared agent transcripts.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Library source lives in `src/`, with separate signer implementations and shared session/types modules.
- Examples live in `examples/`.
- Package metadata and build scripts live in `package.json`; TS configs live in `tsconfig*.json`.
- Keep new modules focused. Prefer explicit signer or session boundaries over broad shared utility files.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install`: install dependencies.
- `npm run build`: bundle the library and emit type declarations.
- `npm run typecheck`: run the TypeScript compiler without emitting files.
- `npm test`: run the Vitest suite.
- `npm run test:watch`: run tests in watch mode.
- If you change the public API or example flows, update the README and example code together.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use TypeScript throughout and keep public signer/session types explicit.
- Prefer focused modules and user-facing tests over implicit shared state or broad helper buckets.
- Keep PRs tightly scoped. Do not mix unrelated cleanup, formatting churn, or speculative refactors into the same change.
- Temporary or transitional code must include `TODO(#issue):` with the tracking issue for removal.

## Pull Request Guardrails
- PR titles must use Conventional Commit format: `type(scope): summary` or `type: summary`.
- Set the correct PR title when opening the PR. Do not rely on fixing it afterward.
- If a PR title changes after opening, verify that the semantic PR title check reruns successfully.
- PR descriptions must include a short summary, motivation, linked issue, and manual test plan.
- Changes to signer behavior, session persistence, OAuth flow, or the public API should include representative usage snippets or migration notes when helpful.

## Security & Sensitive Information
- Do not commit secrets, live tokens, private keys, or sensitive user session data.
- Public issues, PRs, branch names, screenshots, and descriptions must not mention corporate partners, customers, brands, campaign names, or other sensitive external identities unless a maintainer explicitly approves it. Use generic descriptors instead.
